rect exp 1a & exp 1b data key
note that critical trial specific data will be NA on catch trials
and that catch trial specific data will be NA on critical trials

The data file for exp1a has "FIXEDSPEKTOR" in the title because on the Spektor (triangle) trials, the height and width of the competitor and target rectangle trials were initially flipped around in the data. That is, the W rectangles were classified as H, and vice versa. This has been fixed in the updated file (on which all analyses are based). 
===================
